When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.\n\nStart with the mockup \n\nImagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.\n\nThe JSON API returns some data that looks like this:\n\n[\n\n  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple" },\n\n  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit" },\n\n  { category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit" },\n\n  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach" },\n\n  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin" },\n\n  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas" }\n\n]\n\nThe mockup looks like this:\n\nTo implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps.\n\nStep 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy \n\nStart by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them!\n\nDepending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:\n\nProgramming‚Äîuse the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.\nCSS‚Äîconsider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)\nDesign‚Äîconsider how you would organize the design‚Äôs layers.\n\nIf your JSON is well-structured, you‚Äôll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That‚Äôs because UI and data models often have the same information architecture‚Äîthat is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.\n\nThere are five components on this screen:\n\nFilterableProductTable (grey) contains the entire app.\nSearchBar (blue) receives the user input.\nProductTable (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.\nProductCategoryRow (green) displays a heading for each category.\nProductRow (yellow) displays a row for each product.\n\nIf you look at ProductTable (lavender), you‚Äôll see that the table header (containing the ‚ÄúName‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù labels) isn‚Äôt its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of ProductTable because it appears inside the ProductTable‚Äôs list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own ProductTableHeader component.\n\nNow that you‚Äôve identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:\n\nFilterableProductTable\nSearchBar\nProductTable\nProductCategoryRow\nProductRow\nStep 2: Build a static version in React \n\nNow that you have your component hierarchy, it‚Äôs time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity‚Ä¶ yet! It‚Äôs often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.\n\nTo build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you‚Äôll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you‚Äôre familiar with the concept of state, don‚Äôt use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don‚Äôt need it.)\n\nYou can either build ‚Äútop down‚Äù by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like FilterableProductTable) or ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù by working from components lower down (like ProductRow). In simpler examples, it‚Äôs usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it‚Äôs easier to go bottom-up.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan="2">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: \'red\' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar() {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />\n      <label>\n        <input type="checkbox" />\n        {\' \'}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar />\n      <ProductTable products={products} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\n(If this code looks intimidating, go through the Quick Start first!)\n\nAfter building your components, you‚Äôll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. This is called one-way data flow because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree.\n\nPitfall\n\nAt this point, you should not be using any state values. That‚Äôs for the next step!\n\nStep 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state \n\nTo make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use state for this.\n\nThink of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you‚Äôre building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don‚Äôt store the number of items as another state value‚Äîinstead, read the length of your array.\n\nNow think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:\n\nThe original list of products\nThe search text the user has entered\nThe value of the checkbox\nThe filtered list of products\n\nWhich of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:\n\nDoes it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.\nIs it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.\nCan you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn‚Äôt state!\n\nWhat‚Äôs left is probably state.\n\nLet‚Äôs go through them one by one again:\n\nThe original list of products is passed in as props, so it‚Äôs not state.\nThe search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can‚Äôt be computed from anything.\nThe value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can‚Äôt be computed from anything.\nThe filtered list of products isn‚Äôt state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.\n\nThis means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!\n\nDEEP DIVE\nProps vs State \nShow Details\nStep 4: Identify where your state should live \n\nAfter identifying your app‚Äôs minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you‚Äôre new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps!\n\nFor each piece of state in your application:\n\nIdentify every component that renders something based on that state.\nFind their closest common parent component‚Äîa component above them all in the hierarchy.\nDecide where the state should live:\nOften, you can put the state directly into their common parent.\nYou can also put the state into some component above their common parent.\nIf you can‚Äôt find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.\n\nIn the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place.\n\nNow let‚Äôs run through our strategy for them:\n\nIdentify components that use state:\nProductTable needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).\nSearchBar needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).\nFind their common parent: The first parent component both components share is FilterableProductTable.\nDecide where the state lives: We‚Äôll keep the filter text and checked state values in FilterableProductTable.\n\nSo the state values will live in FilterableProductTable.\n\nAdd state to the component with the useState() Hook. Hooks are special functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React. Add two state variables at the top of FilterableProductTable and specify their initial state:\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState(\'\');\n\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\nThen, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as props:\n\n<div>\n\n  <SearchBar \n\n    filterText={filterText} \n\n    inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n\n  <ProductTable \n\n    products={products}\n\n    filterText={filterText}\n\n    inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n\n</div>\n\nYou can start seeing how your application will behave. Edit the filterText initial value from useState(\'\') to useState(\'fruit\') in the sandbox code below. You‚Äôll see both the search input text and the table update:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from \'react\';\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState(\'\');\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar \n        filterText={filterText} \n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n      <ProductTable \n        products={products}\n        filterText={filterText}\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan="2">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: \'red\' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products, filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (\n      product.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\n        filterText.toLowerCase()\n      ) === -1\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (inStockOnly && !product.stocked) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar({ filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input \n        type="text" \n        value={filterText} \n        placeholder="Search..."/>\n      <label>\n        <input \n          type="checkbox" \n          checked={inStockOnly} />\n        {\' \'}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that editing the form doesn‚Äôt work yet. There is a console error in the sandbox above explaining why:\n\nConsole\nYou provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field.\n\nIn the sandbox above, ProductTable and SearchBar read the filterText and inStockOnly props to render the table, the input, and the checkbox. For example, here is how SearchBar populates the input value:\n\nfunction SearchBar({ filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <input \n\n        type="text" \n\n        value={filterText} \n\n        placeholder="Search..."/>\n\nHowever, you haven‚Äôt added any code to respond to the user actions like typing yet. This will be your final step.\n\nStep 5: Add inverse data flow \n\nCurrently your app renders correctly with props and state flowing down the hierarchy. But to change the state according to user input, you will need to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.\n\nReact makes this data flow explicit, but it requires a little more typing than two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you‚Äôll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional. By writing <input value={filterText} />, you‚Äôve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the filterText state passed in from FilterableProductTable. Since filterText state is never set, the input never changes.\n\nYou want to make it so whenever the user changes the form inputs, the state updates to reflect those changes. The state is owned by FilterableProductTable, so only it can call setFilterText and setInStockOnly. To let SearchBar update the FilterableProductTable‚Äôs state, you need to pass these functions down to SearchBar:\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState(\'\');\n\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <SearchBar \n\n        filterText={filterText} \n\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly}\n\n        onFilterTextChange={setFilterText}\n\n        onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />\n\nInside the SearchBar, you will add the onChange event handlers and set the parent state from them:\n\n<input \n\n  type="text" \n\n  value={filterText} \n\n  placeholder="Search..." \n\n  onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)} />\n\nNow the application fully works!\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from \'react\';\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState(\'\');\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar \n        filterText={filterText} \n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} \n        onFilterTextChange={setFilterText} \n        onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />\n      <ProductTable \n        products={products} \n        filterText={filterText}\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan="2">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: \'red\' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products, filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (\n      product.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\n        filterText.toLowerCase()\n      ) === -1\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (inStockOnly && !product.stocked) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar({\n  filterText,\n  inStockOnly,\n  onFilterTextChange,\n  onInStockOnlyChange\n}) {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input \n        type="text" \n        value={filterText} placeholder="Search..." \n        onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)} />\n      <label>\n        <input \n          type="checkbox" \n          checked={inStockOnly} \n          onChange={(e) => onInStockOnlyChange(e.target.checked)} />\n        {\' \'}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit"},\n  {category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin"},\n  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can learn all about handling events and updating state in the Adding Interactivity section.\n\nWhere to go from here \n\nThis was a very brief introduction to how to think about building components and applications with React.
